# Authorization
Authorization is done using [JWT tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token).
Tokens are issued to specific users (either a publisher or admin with a specific ID).
They contain a set of capabilities that the token represents.

```typescript
type Token = {
  tokenId: string,
  issuedTo: string,
  expires: number,
  capabilities: ('admin' | 'publisher' | 'refresh')[]
}
```

By default, tokens also expire after a week. This means that you must refresh
a token for a new one before it expires.


## Acquiring a token
### Exchanging or refreshing an existing token
<RouteDescription httpVerb="POST" path="/v1/auth/exchange"/>
<AccessList ownerAccess adminAccess />

<Tabs items={['Input Payload', 'Success Payload', 'Errors']}>
  <Tab>
    Exchange an old token for a new one with a subset of initial capabilities and an updated expiry time.
    Takes in the old token from the `Authorization` header.

    Input payload:
    ```typescript
    type InputPayload = {
      "issuedTo": string,
      "capabilities": ('admin' | 'publisher' | 'refresh')[]
    }
    ```

    Ensure that `issuedTo` is a valid publisher or admin. [Create one](/api-reference/publisher) if the user doesn't have a publisher/admin acount.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```typescript
    // the signed token in string form
    type ResultPayload = string 
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  - `401`: No token in `Authorization` header
  - `401`: The token is not a refresh token
  - `401`: Requesting more permissions in new token than the existing token has
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Getting the 'root' admin token 
To generate the auth token necessary to make the very first admin user, you must
use the 'root' admin token. This assumes **you have access to the machine on which your
instance of Distributed Press runs on.** This is usually only the case if you are the administrator
which set up the instance.

In the root directory of `api.distributed.press`, execute `npm run make-admin` which will print out the token to stdout.

If this is *not* you, please ask your administrator to issue a token to you.

## Revoking a token
<RouteDescription httpVerb="DELETE" path="/v1/auth/revoke/:tokenId"/>
<AccessList adminAccess />


<Tabs items={['Input Payload', 'Errors']}>
  <Tab>
    Takes a single path parameter `tokenId` and revokes that token along with all tokens issued using that token recursively.
    Note that revoking a non-existent token is a no-op.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
  - `401`: Token expired 
  - `401`: If the associated JWT token is invalid or does not have the appropriate privileges
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
