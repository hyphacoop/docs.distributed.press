# Technical Overview

Distributed Press has many components that work together.

## API Server
The API server is how clients interface with Distributed Press. 

Clients make authenticated HTTP requests to make updates to resources 
like publishers, admins, and sites.

The API server is responsible for locally storing site data to serve and 
seed over the various [peer-to-peer protocols](./protocols) that Distributed Press supports.

See the [API reference](./api-reference/) for more details.


## DNS
The DNS server runs alongside the Distributed Press API and is responsible
for resolving DNS queries for sites that it hosts.

This means that if you own the domain for the site you host (e.g. `distributed.press`),
you can add an `NS` record through your domain registrar to tell it to look at
Distributed Press for where to find where the site is actually hosted.

Then, the Distributed Press DNS server will respond with a `_dnslink` TXT
record that will detail an appropriate HTTP gateway to reach that site from.

This means that *anyone* can access a site published using Distributed Press 
using a normal browser.

See the page on [DNS](./dns) for more details on how to set this up.
