# Technical Overview
## What happens when you publish a site to Distributed Press?
When you [upload content to a site](./api-reference/site#uploading-content-to-a-site) on Distributed Press, the server first 
extracts the files to a temporary folder on the server.

Then, the server looks up the associated configuration for the site. It figures out what 
protocols the user has indicated interest in publishing to and then kicks off sync tasks
for the enabled protocols.

### IPFS
For IPFS, the associated logic is [in this file](https://github.com/hyphacoop/api.distributed.press/blob/main/protocols/ipfs.ts).
The main things you need to know is that Distributed Press keeps a long-running [helia](https://helia.io/)
instance that is spun-up when Distributed Press starts up. This connection is managed by `js-ipfsd-ctl`.

We then copy the files to an IPFS [Mutable File System (MFS)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/file-systems/) and 
publish it to IPFS. When finished, this returns us a CID. We update the IPNS entry for the site ID to this resulting CID.

This CID and accompanying IPNS entry is used to populate [the `links` section](https://docs.distributed.press/api-reference/site#getting-the-information-of-site):

```typescript
type IPFSLinks = {
  "gateway": string,
  "cid": string,
  "pubKey": string,
  "dnslink": string,
  "enabled": boolean,
  "link": string 
}
```

Normally, this information is provided after you publish changes to a site. If you use the [GitHub action](./deployment/github-actions.mdx),
this is printed to the console in the Action run under the "Publish to Distributed Press" step.

### Holepunch
The associated logic for Holepunch is [in this file](https://github.com/hyphacoop/api.distributed.press/blob/main/protocols/hyper.ts).
Holepunch similarly uses [`localdrive`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/localdrive) which offers a mutable file system API that is similar to Hyperdrive.

We create a drive for each site and then copy the files into it. This is done through `localdrive` as it has a feature to
mirror files from your filesystem to the drive.

When finished, we get the drive URL and similarly populate the `links` section:

```typescript
type HyperLinks = {
  "gateway": string,
  "raw": string,
  "dnslink": string,
  "enabled": boolean,
  "link": string 
}
```

### Wrapping up
We block the async function from returning until all protocols finish publishing. Due to some optimizations
we've done on both the IPFS and Holepunch sides, this process usually takes less than 5 seconds for the average site.

## What happens when you view a site?
### Over a Gateway
The user visits `docs.distributed.press` in their browser.

Their browser queries DNS for where to find the actual content for this domain.

```bash
❯ dig docs.distributed.press A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
docs.distributed.press.                       600   IN	CNAME   docs-distributed-press.ipns.ipfs.hypha.coop.
docs-distributed-press.ipns.ipfs.hypha.coop.  300   IN  CNAME   ipfs.prod.hypha.coop.
ipfs.prod.hypha.coop.                         300   IN  A       104.245.147.222
```

Then, the browser makes a request to that last IP address `104.245.147.222`. The gateway
handles this request and notices that it is requesting the [IPNS service using the DNSLink resolution style](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#gateway-services).

The gateway makes another query to DNS to figure out what the associated CID is for the domain using [DNSLink](https://dnslink.dev/).

```bash
❯ dig _dnslink.docs.distributed.press TXT       

;; ANSWER SECTION:
_dnslink.docs.distributed.press. 49 IN	TXT	"dnslink=/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5dicruj8whyde1z5vtm2tg6q1gey17nb2trkuh4b0m69sl6z85cw/"
_dnslink.docs.distributed.press. 49 IN	TXT	"dnslink=/hyper/smqq19f3gbbz7sn9zko589az9x8ip4ky5g4nce5rnzgywfi13qso/"
```

The node gets this response and looks up the associated CID for the appropriate protocol (IPFS in this case).
If it has this CID, it will respond with the content directly. If it doesn't, it attempts to retrieve it from the network and respond with the content.


### Over NGINX
The user visits `docs.distributed.press` in their browser.

Their browser queries DNS for where to find the actual content for this domain.

```bash
❯ dig docs.distributed.press

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;docs.distributed.press.      IN	A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
docs.distributed.press. 600   IN	CNAME   api.distributed.press.
api.distributed.press.  3600  IN	A       198.50.215.13
```

The browser visits `198.50.215.13` and NGINX serves the files directly back to the browser.

### Using a distributed-web-friendly browser
The user visits `docs.distributed.press` in their browser.

Browsers like Brave and Opera run their own IPFS and/or Holepunch nodes locally and thus will first try finding the content via these nodes before reaching out over regular HTTP.
The browser tells the node to make a query to DNS to figure out what the associated CID is for the domain using [DNSLink](https://dnslink.dev/).

What the browser does here is pretty much identical to the [gateway steps detailed above](#over-a-gateway).
