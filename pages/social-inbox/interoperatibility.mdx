# Interoperability

We've built the Social Inbox by testing it against Mastodon, as well as
Ktistec, Gotosocial and Pleroma.  Since they all implement the same
specification with their own interpretations, and sometimes they add
their own safety checks, you'll probably find quirks.

Please report your findings on our issue tracker.
