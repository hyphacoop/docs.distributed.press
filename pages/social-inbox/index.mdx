# Social Inbox

The **Social Inbox** allows people to integrate their website with the [Fediverse](https://www.fediverse.to/) and engage with readers there.

With this feature, websites obtain their own Fediverse account, allowing it to automatically send out new posts to followers at the time of publication. When other users reply to posts, site admins can approve them to be published to the site as comments. The Social Inbox allows readers to directly engage with posts where they are published, and gives publishers the ability to incorporate public dialogue into their websites.

This Distributed.Press feature splits ActivityPub into statically published web content with a minimal "Inbox Server" that handles incoming messages like follow requests and replies.
