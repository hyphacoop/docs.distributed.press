## Jekyll Activity Pub

[jekyll-activity-pub](https://jekyll-activity-pub.sutty.nl/) is a Jekyll
plugin that implements the outbox and activities on a static website.

key, create/update/delete activities, outbox, and sending out
notifications to the Social Inbox.

It also provides Liquid helpers to fetch information from the Social
Inbox and remotes instances.
