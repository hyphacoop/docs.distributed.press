## Our Vision

We are building the _Distributed Press_ — an open-source publishing tool for the distributed web. Aiming to empower authors, _Distributed Press_ utilizes the distributed web to amplify publishing organizations and authors anywhere. Distributed Press adds peer-to-peer (P2P) and decentralized protocols to any CMS, for content distribution and archiving. 

We all have a sense of the wide-ranging and complex issues facing publishing today: political censorship, disinformation, walled gardens, and the [decline of independent media][decline of independent media]. Yet the solutions to these challenges remain unclear. Working with authors, audiences, and distributed web communities, we are co-developing new tools, in order to make publishing fair, democratic, and dignified for all.

Our approach is to engage and learn from broader communities who actively research the issues outlined above and those that practice alternative publishing models. With them, we wish to investigate if and how the distributed web can better serve the publishing ecosystem. As a means to this end, we have created [COMPOST](https://three.compost.digital/) a journal for and by the citizens of the distributed web, and test its resilience against the challenges facing publishing today.

## Today, centralized platforms wield disproportionate power

Of the [3.9 billion Internet users worldwide][3.9 billion Internet users worldwide], Facebook, Tencent, and Google now mediate a majority of global public discourse. As recent history shows, such extreme power consolidation can be readily abused to [influence political outcomes][influence political outcomes], [censor citizens][censor citizens], and create an [anti-competitive market][anti-competitive market].

## The distributed web presents emerging alternatives

<img src="/img/distributed-press-1.svg"/>

The promise of the Distributed Web (DWeb) is that it gives everyone the ability to control their digital networks and platforms. In distributed networks, the underlying code, data, and network infrastructure are managed by many. 

## We are trapped by network effects

Centralized platforms with large networks like Facebook and Medium are still unmatched for promoting and discovering new content.

Content authors and audiences who are attracted to the promise of the distributed web are compelled to maintain a presence on centralized platforms in order to access wider viewership and content.

With the inherently fragmented nature of the distributed web, content dissemination and discovery is a recognized challenge. However, initiatives such as [IndieWeb][IndieWeb]'s syndication model and [Micro.blog][Micro.blog]'s decoupling of the timeline from post storage have shown us an encouraging path forward.

## Censorship resistant content dissemination

Distributed web technologies [claim to resist centralized censors][claim to resist centralized censors]. But even the most distributed technologies have [chokepoints that can be exploited][chokepoints that can be exploited] by private or state actors to undermine people's free expression. As a result, circumventing censorship [necessitates particular practices][necessitates particular practices].

We plan to utilize tools such as the [OONI Probe][OONI Probe] to measure worldwide content dissemination and evaluate compatibility of distributed web protocols with independently operated network infrastructure, such as [offline mesh networks][offline mesh networks] where packets travel through channels out of reach from state censors.

**Over the past three years, we have deployed and maintained an open source tool that authors can use to publish content to the DWeb and WWW.** The tool streamlines distribution and archiving on the DWeb. In the future, we hope it will guide authors to establish creator-owned cooperative publications. 

## Research will be made public for a wider community of researchers and developers

Research topics:
- Applicability of distributed web protocols for digital authorship
- Mechanisms for disintermediated content dissemination
- Economic viability of distributed publishing
- Compatibility with current alternative publishing tools and practices
- Publishing practices that resist centralized censorship

Research methods:
- Informational interviews with diverse community members and partners
- Comparative survey of publishing on the distributed web versus the World Wide Web
- Secondary research looking at existing literature
- Technical prototyping with available distributed web protocols and tools
- Co-creation activities with content authors and readers
