# explore.distributed.press
This project generates a website that lists all sites published through Distributed Press. It displays the total number of sites along with their domains, titles, descriptions, and IPFS/Hyper public keys. The list is automatically filtered, sorted, and sanitized before generating a static HTML page for easy browsing of DWeb sites.

## Adding a Manual Site

Some sites may not be auto-crawled, but you can manually add them. To do this, edit the site data file `manualSites.json` and append a new entry:
```js
[
    {
      "domain": "manual-site-1.com",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "Manually Added Site",
        "description": "This site was added manually."
      },
      "links": {
        "http": {
          "enabled": true,
          "link": "http://manual-site-1.com"
        },
        "hyper": {
          "enabled": false
        },
        "ipfs": {
          "enabled": false
        }
      },
      "public": true
    }
]
```

After adding sites, generate the index by running:
```sh
npm start
```

This will generate files for the indexer in the `./public` directory.
