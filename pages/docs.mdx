# Editing Documentation
You are currently looking at the documentation for [Distributed Press](https://distributed.press/)! 
The source for this site currently lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/hyphacoop/docs.distributed.press).

This site uses [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) which uses MDX for content.
**For most copy-editing changes, you can likely just edit the appropriate MDX file for each page.**
To find the appropriate file for a page, you can click the `Edit this page` link on the right sidebar of that page. 

This site is automatically re-deployed using the Distributed Press [GitHub Action](./deployment/github-actions) so
any changes are reflected on the site almost immediately.

## Structure
For more involved changes, here is a rough overview of what's what:

- `theme.config.jsx`: Configuration for the Nextra theme, including logo, colours, footer, etc.
- `pages/_meta.json`: Page-specific metadata, controls titles and ordering in the sidebar 
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`: GitHub workflow for deploying the current site
