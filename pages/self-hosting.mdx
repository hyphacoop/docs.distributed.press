# Self-Hosting

Distributed Press uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to make setting up
your own Distributed Press instance fast and simple.

These scripts can help you deploy Distributed Press on your own VPS via SSH.

The default playbook will deploy your `distributed.press` instance and set up all the appropriate Firewall configurations
to allow Distributed Press to work properly.

Please ensure you have both Python 3 and Ansible installed before proceeding with the setup steps.

## Steps

1. Edit `inventory.yml` to specify your own domain to run the scripts on as well as any variables you wish to set.

   Specifically, you *must* specify the `distributed_press_domain` do be your server, and your `distributed_press_letsencrypt_email` for registering the HTTPS certificate.
   You *may* specify a list of domains in `distributed_press_served_sites` which specifies which domains you'd like to serve over HTTPS in addition to the peer-to-peer protocols.

```yaml filename="inventory.yml" {4-5}
all:
  # Set custom variables here, like custom ports for listening
  vars:
    distributed_press_domain: "example.com"
    distributed_press_letsencrypt_email: "example@example.com"
    distributed_press_served_sites: []
  children:
    distributed_press:
      hosts:
        example.com:
          ansible_user: root
```

2. Install the dependencies
  
   ```bash
   $ ansible-galaxy install -r ./requirements.yml
   ```
3. Execute the playbook
   ```bash
   # execute the Ansible playbook with user defined variables
   $ ansible-playbook distributed_press.yml -i inventory.yml
   ```

## Debugging
1. Check the status of the service: `systemctl status distributed.press`
2. Follow the logs of the service: `journalctl -fu distributed.press`
