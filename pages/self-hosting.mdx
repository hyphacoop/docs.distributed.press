# Self-Hosting

Distributed Press uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to make setting up
your own Distributed Press instance fast and simple.

These scripts can help you deploy Distributed Press on your own VPS via SSH.

The default playbook will deploy your `distributed.press` instance and set up all the appropriate Firewall configurations
to allow Distributed Press to work properly.

Please ensure you have both Python 3 and Ansible installed before proceeding with the setup steps.

The deployment scripts work best on Debian 11 but should also work on Ubuntu 22.

If you don't have a machine set up or aren't sure where to get started we recommend using a [Digital Ocean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/droplets) with at least 4GB of ram (though 8 GH can help if you have a lot of IPFS traffic).

## Steps

1. Edit `inventory.yml` to specify your own domain to run the scripts on as well as any variables you wish to set.

   Specifically, you *must* specify the `distributed_press_domain` do be your server, and your `distributed_press_letsencrypt_email` for registering the HTTPS certificate.
   You *may* specify a list of domains in `distributed_press_served_sites` which specifies which domains you'd like to serve over HTTPS in addition to the peer-to-peer protocols.

```yaml filename="inventory.yml" {4-5}
all:
  # Set custom variables here, like custom ports for listening
  vars:
    distributed_press_domain: "example.com"
    distributed_press_letsencrypt_email: "example@example.com"
    distributed_press_served_sites: []
  children:
    distributed_press:
      hosts:
        example.com:
          ansible_user: root
```

2. Install the dependencies
  
   ```bash
   $ ansible-galaxy install -r ./requirements.yml
   ```

3. Execute the playbook

   ```bash
   # execute the Ansible playbook with user defined variables
   $ ansible-playbook distributed_press.yml -i inventory.yml
   ```

4. Generate an "admin token"

First, SSH into your instance with `ssh root@example.com`.

Then run the following:

   ```bash
   # stop the service so we can update its database
   sudo systemctl stop distributed.press.service

   # switch to the "press" user
   su press

   # navigate to the distributed press codebase
   cd ~/api.distributed.press

   # Create a new admin account and get a token for them
   npm run make-admin

   # Copy the output of this command, this is what you'll need to make new publisher tokens

   # switch back to `root` user
   exit

   # start up distributed press again
   sudo systemctl start distributed.press.service
   ```

Make sure to save that token somewhere secure and secret like a password vault in your OS or a service like [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/products/personal/).

This will be used to create any new admins or publishers and do administrative tasks.

5. Generate your first "publisher token"

Now that we have your admin account, you can create a new "publisher" for making sites.

Navigate to your Distributed Press instance and go to `/v1/docs` which will open up the Open-API interface to talk to your instance.

From here click the `Authorize` button and enter your admin token from step 4.

Next go to section titled `POST /publisher` and click "Try it out".

Replace the text "string" with some sort of name or domain. e.g. if your publisher is Hypha, you can use `hypha.coop` for their name.

Then hit `Execute` to create the publisher.

Copy the `id` field from the response and place it in the `issuedTo` field in the `POST /v1/auth/exchange` API.
Make sure to remove `admin` from the set of capabilities.

Hit `Execute` and send the resulting token to your publisher to use in either API calls or in the [Distributed Press Github Action](/deployment/github-actions). 

## Steps - Social Inbox

If you're interested in publishing your site on the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), you can also self host your own instance of the Distributed Press [Social Inbox](/social-inbox).

1. Go through steps 1 & 2 for the Distributed Press API

2. Modify the `vars` section of your `inventory.yml` to enable the inbox. You *MUST* supply a new domain for the `social_inbox_domain` field for the domain the inbox will be hosted on.

```yaml filename="inventory.yml" {4-5}
all:
  # Set custom variables here, like custom ports for listening
  vars:
    distributed_press_domain: "example.com"
    distributed_press_letsencrypt_email: "example@example.com"
    distributed_press_served_sites: []
    social_inbox_enabled: true
    social_inbox_domain: "social.example.com"
  children:
    distributed_press:
      hosts:
        example.com:
          ansible_user: root
```

3. Run the playbook to deploy


   ```bash
   # execute the Ansible playbook with user defined variables
   $ ansible-playbook distributed_press.yml -i inventory.yml
   ```

From here you can make use of the [Jekyll Plugin](https://0xacab.org/sutty/jekyll/jekyll-activity-pub) or use the social inbox APIs directly from your code.

## Debugging

After SSHing into your VM you can use these commands to get you started:

1. Check the status of the service: `systemctl status distributed.press`
2. Follow the logs of the service: `journalctl -fu distributed.press`
3. `sudo su press` switch to the distributed.press "user" and `cd ~` to tinker with the data and source code manually.
