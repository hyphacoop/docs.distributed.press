# Deploying with Github Actions
<APIWarning/>

If you are used to deploying to GitHub pages or any other hosting provider
that uses GitHub actions, `actions-distributed-press` allows you to 
just add a single step to your actions workflow to also deploy a bundle 
of static files to Distributed Press.


<Callout type="info">
Distributed Press only supports deploying a folder of static files.
Most frameworks like Next.js, React, and Hugo, allow you to 'export'
or 'build' your site as bunch of static files.
</Callout>

[Read the source here](https://github.com/hyphacoop/actions-distributed-press/tree/main/src
)

To your existing action workflow, add a step to publish to Distributed Press. Additionally,
[add an encrypted secret in your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) containing a valid refresh token issued your 
specified Distributed Press API instance.

The name of the secret should be `REFRESH_TOKEN` and the value should be the JWT itself.
If you are unsure where to get a JWT token, see the reference on [authorization](/api-reference/auth)

```yaml {6}
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        ... steps to build your site go here 
      - name: Publish to Distributed Press
        uses: hyphacoop/actions-distributed-press@v1.1
        with:
          publish_dir: public                           # (optional) defaults to /public
          dp_url: https://your-hosted.dp.instance       # URL of Distributed Press API Instance (include http/https)
          refresh_token: ${{ secrets.REFRESH_TOKEN }}   # Refresh token 
          site_url: docs.distributed.press              # Site domain (as created through the API) 
          deploy_http: false
          deploy_hyper: true
          deploy_ipfs: true
```

## Example Next.js Deployment
In your repository, create a new file `github/workflows/deploy-distributed-press.yaml`

```yaml filename="deploy-distributed-press.yaml"
name: "Publish GitHub Action"
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Use Node.js 18
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: 18
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run build
    - name: Publish to Distributed Press
      uses: hyphacoop/actions-distributed-press@v1.1
      with:
        publish_dir: public
        dp_url: https://your-hosted.dp.instance
        refresh_token: ${{ secrets.REFRESH_TOKEN }}
        site_url: docs.distributed.press
```

This will build and publish your site to the Distributed Press
instance hosted at `https://your-hosted.dp.instance`
