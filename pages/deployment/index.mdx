# Deploying Sites

<APIWarning/>

There are two main supported workflows for deploying sites to
Distributed Press.

1. [Sutty](/deployment/sutty)
2. [GitHub Actions](/deployment/github-actions) 

## Sutty
Sutty provides a content management system (CMS) that allows
users to build and manage the content of their site without 
needing to know how to code it from scratch. The CMS provides 
pre-made themes and templates that makes it easy to
get your site online.

We've partnered with Sutty to also provide a toggle to enable
users to deploy their sites to the distributed web easily.

This is the recommended path for non-technical publishers, artists,
and writers looking to get started with putting content on the distributed
web.

## GitHub Actions
If you already deploy your site to GitHub pages or any other 
static site hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, etc. then
the GitHub action will allow you to also deploy to the 
Distributed Web by adding just a few additional lines of configuration
to your code repository.

This is the recommended path for those with technical experience and
know their way around GitHub and deployments.
