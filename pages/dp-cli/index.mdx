# Welcome to Distributed Press CLI
The [Distributed Press CLI (dpress)](https://github.com/hyphacoop/distributed-press-cli/) is a powerful command-line tool for interacting with the Distributed Press API and Social Inbox. It enables you to manage websites, register ActivityPub actors, and share updates seamlessly across the Fediverseâ€”all from your terminal.

# Two Ways to Publish with Distributed Press CLI
## 1. Publishing Website with Distributed Press API
Using the Distributed Press API, you can publish static websites directly to IPFS, Hypercore, and HTTPS. The `dpress` allows you to create a site, upload content, and manage DNS records seamlessly. For instance, after creating a site, you can use the `dpress publish` command to upload content from your local directory to the Distributed Press infrastructure. Your site becomes available across decentralized protocols, ensuring global accessibility and resilience.

## 2. Sending Posts to the Fediverse via Social Inbox
With the [Social Inbox](/social-inbox) integration, you can share ActivityPub posts to your followers on the Fediverse. By combining `dpress` with the [Staticpub template](https://github.com/hyphacoop/staticpub.distributed.press), you can create a website that doubles as an ActivityPub actor. After setting up your actor and registering it with the Social Inbox, use the `dpress send-post` command to share posts directly from your terminal, reaching your followers securely and efficiently.
