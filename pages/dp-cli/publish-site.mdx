## Publish Website

### Register as Publisher

Register a trial publisher account on Distributed Press using your email:

```bash
dp-cli register
```

You will be prompted for your name and email. Note: currently, only one site per email is allowed.

### OR Set Your Authentication Token Manually

Obtain your `authToken` from your Distributed Press API administrator and set it using:

```bash
dp-cli set-auth-token
```

You will be prompted to enter your authentication token.

### Create Your Site

Once registered, create a new site by specifying the domain name and whether it should be public:

```bash
dp-cli create-site
```

### Publish Your Site

To upload and publish static content to the DP site from a specified directory:

```bash
dp-cli publish ./folder_here
```

### DNS Setup

To use a custom domain for your Distributed Press site, you'll need to set up a DNS record to point to the Distributed Press infrastructure.

#### Using Distributed Press Infrastructure
- If you wish to use the official Distributed Press instance for your HTTPS traffic, [contact](mailto:hello@distributed.press) the Distributed Press team.
- Alternatively, refer to the [documentation for self-hosting](https://docs.distributed.press/self-hosting/) for guidance on running your own infrastructure.

### CNAME Record

| Type  | Name          | Value                    |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------------------ |
| CNAME | `<your-site>` | `api.distributed.press.` |

- Replace `your-site`` with your domain or subdomain name.
- Ensure that the trailing dot `.` is included in `api.distributed.press.` as required.

### _dnslink Record

To make your site accessible through Distributed Press, set an `NS Record` to delegate DNSLink lookups to Distributed Press.

| Type | Name                   | Value                              |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| NS  | `_dnslink.your.domain` | `api.distributed.press.`   |

- This eliminates the need to manually set TXT records.
- [contact](mailto:hello@distributed.press) the Distributed Press team for assistance if needed.

### Example

If your site links include:

```json
"ipfs": {
  "dnslink": "/ipns/k51qzi5uqu5djj6yo1nne5r2oomxgroy3tezhgupvx0v2jlbighfah1k028sc1/"
},
"hyper": {
  "dnslink": "/hyper/t685fd3snbadhqkss8spcgz454p95ap77kdfjafotsxfhhrhuqio/"
}
```

You only need to configure the `NS Record` as shown above. DNSLink propagation will handle IPFS and Hyper links automatically.

After DNS propagation, users will be able to access the site at `example.com` over IPFS and Hyper.
- ipns://example.com
- hyper://example.com

### SSL Requirements
To use your custom domain, ensure that your domain has a valid HTTPS certificate. Most DNS providers offer free certificate generation via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) or similar services.

## Clone an Existing Site

Clone a website by creating a static copy from its HTTP URL:

```bash
dp-cli clone <site-id>
```

## Configuration

The CLI uses a configuration file named `.dprc` to store API URLs, authentication tokens, keypairs, and actor information. The configuration file follows the format expected by the [`rc` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc), which loads configuration options in a flexible way.

Your `.dprc` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "dpApiUrl": "https://api.distributed.press/v1",
  "socialInboxUrl": "https://social.distributed.press/v1",
  "authToken": "<your-auth-token>",
  "domain": "<your-site-domain>",
}
```

- **`dpApiUrl`:** The base URL for the Distributed Press API.
- **`socialInboxUrl`:** The base URL for the Social Inbox.
- **`authToken`:** Your authentication token for API access.
- **`domain`:** Your custom domain for the site, e.g., example.com.

_Ensure that your `.dprc` file is **not** committed to version control to keep your credentials secure._
