### Use Staticpub Template
1. Fork the Repository:
Visit the [staticpub.distributed.press](https://github.com/hyphacoop/staticpub.distributed.press) repository on GitHub and click the "[Fork](https://github.com/hyphacoop/staticpub.distributed.press/fork)" button to create your own copy.

2. Clone Your Fork:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyphacoop/staticpub.distributed.press.git
cd staticpub.distributed.press
```

3. Replace Domain, Username, and Name:

### For Linux Users:

```bash
find . -type f -exec sed -i 's/staticpub\.mauve\.moe/yourdomain\.com/g; s/mauve/username/g; s/"Mauve"/"Your Name"/g' {} +
```

### For macOS Users:

```bash
find . -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/staticpub\.mauve\.moe/yourdomain\.com/g; s/mauve/username/g; s/"Mauve"/"Your Name"/g' {} +
```

**This will replace:**
- `staticpub.mauve.moe` → `yourdomain.com`
- `mauve` → `yourusername`
- `Mauve` → `Your Name`

Make sure to update the `publicKeyPem` field in the following files with your actual public key from the `.dprc` configuration file:

- `about.jsonld`
- `about-ipns.jsonld`

### How to Find Your Public Key:

1. Open your `.dprc` file (generated during setup).
2. Copy the value of `"publicKeyPem"` (including the `BEGIN` and `END` lines).
3. Paste it into the `publicKeyPem` field in the JSON files mentioned above.

### Example:

```json
    "publicKey": {
      "@context": "https://w3id.org/security/v1",
      "@type": "Key",
      "id": "https://staticpub.mauve.moe/about.jsonld#main-key",
      "owner": "https://staticpub.mauve.moe/about.jsonld",
      "publicKeyPem": "-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nYOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"
    }
```

Replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE` with your actual public key from `.dprc`.

For using the Social Inbox, you need to generate a keypair and register your ActivityPub actor.

### Generate a Keypair

Run the following command to generate a new RSA keypair:

```bash
dp-cli generate-keypair
```

**Purpose:**  
This keypair is used for authenticating your interactions with the Social Inbox and the fediverse at large, ensuring secure communication and verifying your identity.

**Note:**  
If you only plan to use the DP API for static file publishing, generating a keypair might not be necessary. However, it's recommended for enhanced security and functionality when interacting with the Social Inbox.

This will generate a keypair and save it to your `.dprc` configuration file.

### Register Your Actor

Register your ActivityPub actor with the Social Inbox:

```bash
dp-cli register-actor
```

This will register your actor with the Social Inbox and save the details to your configuration.

### Publish the Staticpub Template

Please follow the steps from this section:
- [Publish Site With Distributed Press API](/sdk/publish-site.mdx)

### Send a Post to Followers

Published the template? Now, let's send a post to your followers:

```bash
dp-cli send-post ./path_to_activity.json
```

#### Example (as per the staticpub template):
```bash
dp-cli send-post ./posts/helloworld.jsonld
```

### Patch a Site
After publishing your site and registering your actor, you might need to update your site with new content or activities. Use the `patch` command to add the note/activity JSON and update the outbox with the new activity.

```bash
dp-cli patch -i <site-id> ./path_to_patch_folder
```

## Configuration

The CLI uses a configuration file named `.dprc` to store API URLs, authentication tokens, keypairs, and actor information. The configuration file follows the format expected by the [`rc` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc), which loads configuration options in a flexible way.

Your `.dprc` file should look like this:

```json
{
  "dpApiUrl": "https://api.distributed.press/v1",
  "socialInboxUrl": "https://social.distributed.press/v1",
  "authToken": "<your-auth-token>",
  "keypair": {
    "publicKeyPem": "<your-public-key>",
    "privateKeyPem": "<your-private-key>"
  },
  "domain": "<your-site-domain>",
  "actorUsername": "<your-actor-username>",
  "actorUrl": "<your-actor-url>",
  "publicKeyId": "<your-public-key-id>"
}
```

- **`dpApiUrl`:** The base URL for the Distributed Press API.
- **`socialInboxUrl`:** The base URL for the Social Inbox.
- **`authToken`:** Your authentication token for API access.
- **`keypair`:** Your public and private keys for secure interactions.
- **`domain`:** Your custom domain for the site, e.g., example.com.
- **`actorUsername`:** Your ActivityPub actor username.
- **`actorUrl`:** The URL of your actor.
- **`publicKeyId`:** The ID of your public key.

_Ensure that your `.dprc` file is **not** committed to version control to keep your credentials secure._
