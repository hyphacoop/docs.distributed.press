# Social Reader

The **Social Reader** is a P2P and offline ActivityPub client for reading and following microblogs on the [Fediverse](https://www.fediverse.to/). It stands out by not indexing data on a server but instead empowering users to load public ActivityPub data directly onto their devices, turning each device into a personal indexer. This approach ensures that you control your content fully.

## Key Features
- **Direct Content Loading:** Load public ActivityPub data directly without server indexing.
- **P2P Support:** Natively supports content loading over P2P protocols like [ipfs://](https://ipfs.tech/) and [hyper://](https://holepunch.to/), allowing access anytime, anywhereâ€”even offline.
- **Low-Tech Philosophy:** Built with minimal dependencies using vanilla JavaScript, unminified scripts, and local storage via IndexedDB.

## Why Social Reader?
Social Reader removes the middleman from digital interactions, facilitating direct communication with audiences without third-party interference or algorithms. This ad-free experience prioritizes user autonomy, making Social Reader ideal for community leaders and organizations who value genuine engagement.

## FAQs
### How do I create an account on Social Reader?
- Social Reader is designed as a reading and following client, which means you cannot create an account directly within the app. To actively write and contribute to the Fediverse, you would need to interact with the [Social Inbox](https://hypha.coop/dripline/announcing-dp-social-inbox/) API. This can be done through platforms like [Sutty CMS](https://sutty.nl/) or by forking and hosting your own instance of [Staticpub](https://github.com/RangerMauve/staticpub.mauve.moe) repository. If you're a community or organization that would like to combine the two for your use case, send us an email.

### Why is Social Reader different from mainstream social platforms?
- Social Reader ensures direct communication with your audience, free from ads and third-party algorithms. This setup not only fosters genuine interaction but also allows organizations and community leaders to engage their followers without the need to pay for reach, a common requirement on traditional social networks.
